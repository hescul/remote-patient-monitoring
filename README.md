# Remote Patient Monitoring
**Brief:** statistic says that more than 30% of medical patients re-admit into the hospital after surgery. One of the causing is attributed to the lack of monitoring infrastructure when the patients go home. In the time when Covid-19 is threatening face-to-face interaction, the situation gets even worse. With remote monitoring IoT system, doctors can now monitor patient status through sensors embedded on patients' wearable devices, hence preventing fatal cases from emerging.

To resolve the previous stated challenge, we propose an IoT system based on Timothy Chou’s IoT architecture. The main goal here is to break the gap between doctors and their patients. This association relationship must be maintained and operated seamlessly because the stake of the patients depends on the integrity of the system. With the project titled Remote Patient Monitoring, we aim to build a remote monitor system that constantly and securely transfers a patient’s status to his/her associated doctor.
