  Optical SP02 Detection (SPK Algorithm) using the MAX30105 Breakout

  This demo shows heart rate and SPO2 levels.

  It is best to attach the sensor to your finger using a rubber band or other tightening 
  device. Humans are generally bad at applying constant pressure to a thing. When you 
  press your finger against the sensor it varies enough to cause the blood in your 
  finger to flow differently which causes the sensor readings to go wonky.

  This example is based on MAXREFDES117 and RD117_LILYPAD.ino from Maxim. Their example
  was modified to work with the SparkFun MAX30105 library and to compile under Arduino 1.6.11
  Please see license file for more info.

  Hardware Connections (Breakoutboard to Arduino):
  -5V = 5V (3.3V is allowed)
  -GND = GND
  -SDA = A4 (or SDA)
  -SCL = A5 (or SCL)
  -INT = Not connected
 
  The MAX30105 Breakout can handle 5V or 3.3V I2C logic. We recommend powering the board with 5V
  but it will also run at 3.3V.
